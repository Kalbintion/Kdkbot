<div class="boxNewsDate">17 April, 2017 - Base Commands, Contact Me</div>
<div class="boxNewsContent"><a href="?p=basecommands">Base commands</a> have been added to the page. These are not entirly completed yet but a lot of simple information is available there. If you are in need of immediate information, please check the wiki as that is most up to date. The <a href="?p=contact">contact</a> page has been updated to include information on contacting me in the event you need to.<br />
<br />
Channel quotes, timed messages, and some other missing features will be worked on when time is available to work on them. Presently looking at a channel via the channels page only offers their command list. <br />
<br />
Also, in the event you see your channel image is outdated in the event you updated it (note: it grabs your profile picture), please let me know by sending me an email that can be found via the Contact Me page or by sending a twitch message. A system is not yet in place to purge these caches just yet.<br />

<div class="boxNewsDate">13 April, 2017 - First Up!</div>
<div class="boxNewsContent">Welcome to the Kdkbot website! This website is still under construction, but still has a bit of functionality within it that is still accessible. You can currently only view the commands available to a channel but hope to see all of this expand quickly.<br />
<br />
Some of the things that I would like to do with this website include:
<ul>
<li>having a proper news page where it isn't hard-coded like this news message is</li>
<li>allowing people to authorize the bot to use channel specific features (game set, etc)</li>
</ul>

There are longer term goals for the web interface, a lot of the above and the below are marked on the github page, but for covering sake:
<ul>
<li>allowing people to manage some of the bots options through the web interface</li>
</ul>

I am sure I have left out some stuff in the details, but I'll be announcing when new features and the like happen over time.
