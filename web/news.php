<div class="boxNewsDate">9 May, 2017 - Updates</div>
<div class="boxNewsContent">Message forwarding was implemented, tested, and some bugs have been fixed overall!<br >
Status and game commands no longer have issues with special characters.
<br /><br />
<b>Message Forwarding</b>: Have your chat communicate with another channel without having them open up a multi-twitch service! This system allows all messages to be sent from your channel to another, as long as both sides agree to it. Begin by using the command <tt>fwd <i>channel</i></tt>, replacing <i>channel</i> with the channel name you want to forward to. Afterwards, they will have to agree to it by using <tt>afwd <i>channel</i></tt> where <i>channel</i> is the name of the channel the request came from. Once agreed upon, messages will begin being sent between both channels. Once the time has come, use <tt>sfwd <i>channel</i></tt> to stop sending messages between your channel and the channel provided in <i>channel</i>.
<br /><br />
<b>Bug Fixes/Changes</b>:
<ul>
<li>Updated Twitch API to v5</li>
<li>New command: <tt>seen</tt></li>
<li>New command: <tt>bits</tt></li>
<li>New commands: <tt>fwd, afwd, dfwd, sfwd</tt></li>
<li>New characters added to flip table</li>
<li><tt>quotes list</tt> and <tt>commands list</tt> now link to the proper page</li>
<li><tt>stats</tt> commands now appropriately take on a channels prefix and suffix setting</li>
<li>Filter messages now apply channel prefix and suffix setting</li>
</ul>

<div class="boxNewsDate">17 April, 2017 - Base Commands, Contact Me</div>
<div class="boxNewsContent"><a href="?p=basecommands">Base commands</a> have been added to the page. These are not entirly completed yet but a lot of simple information is available there. If you are in need of immediate information, please check the wiki as that is most up to date. The <a href="?p=contact">contact</a> page has been updated to include information on contacting me in the event you need to.<br />
<br />
Channel quotes, timed messages, and some other missing features will be worked on when time is available to work on them. Presently looking at a channel via the channels page only offers their command list. <br />
<br />
Also, in the event you see your channel image is outdated in the event you updated it (note: it grabs your profile picture), please let me know by sending me an email that can be found via the Contact Me page or by sending a twitch message. A system is not yet in place to purge these caches just yet.<br />

<div class="boxNews">
<div class="boxNewsDate">13 April, 2017 - First Up!</div>
<div class="boxNewsContent">Welcome to the Kdkbot website! This website is still under construction, but still has a bit of functionality within it that is still accessible. You can currently only view the commands available to a channel but hope to see all of this expand quickly.<br />
<br />
Some of the things that I would like to do with this website include:
<ul>
<li>having a proper news page where it isn't hard-coded like this news message is</li>
<li>allowing people to authorize the bot to use channel specific features (game set, etc)</li>
</ul>

There are longer term goals for the web interface, a lot of the above and the below are marked on the github page, but for covering sake:
<ul>
<li>allowing people to manage some of the bots options through the web interface</li>
</ul>

I am sure I have left out some stuff in the details, but I'll be announcing when new features and the like happen over time.
